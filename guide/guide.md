# Realtime apps with Angular & NestJS

## Getting started

### Clone Git repo

To begin, clone the starter app from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elylucas/realtime-ng-nest.git
```

The repo folder contains three folders:

- **client**: The Angular app
- **server**: The Nest app
- **guide**: This guide in md and html formats

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm run installdeps
```

This will install the dependencies for both apps.

### Start app

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start both the Angular and Nest apps at the same time. The Angular app
will run on port 4200 and the Nest app will be running on port 3000.

Next, open the folder in your code editor. You can also open the client and
server folder is separate instances of your editor if you choose.

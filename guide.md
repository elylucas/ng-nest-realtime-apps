# Realtime apps with Angular & NestJS

## Prerequisites

You need a recent version of Node installed (this is built with Node 16 ). Visit
[Node's website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install it.

## Getting Started

### Clone Git Repo

To begin, clone the starter app from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elylucas/realtime-ng-nest.git
```

Once downloaded, go into the app folder. The app folder contains two apps. The
client folder is the Angular app, and the server folder is the Nest app.

### Install Dependencies

In the app folder, run:

```bash
npm run installdeps
```

This will install the dependencies for both apps.

Now open the folder in your code editor. If you like, you can open the client
and server folders in separate editor instances.
